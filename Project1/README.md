# Discrete Event Simulation


This program creates uniformly distributed random events in an attempt to imitate user activity, and simulates the use of resources in the system.

## Workspace
Following files are in the workspace:
```c
main.c // The file where the function main() and most program logic is at.

misc.c
misc.h // various supporting functionality and data structures are implemented in misc.c and misc.h

pqueue.c
pqueue.h // priority queue implementation for CPU and Disk queues

conf.txt // configuration file for the simulation. Program takes arguments ONLY from this file.


```
